    <h2>Step 1: Check if Your Licence Can Be Used in Sweden</h2>
    <p>Before applying for a Swedish licence, find out if your <strong
    >current driving licence is valid</strong> here.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If you have an <strong>EU/EEA
          licence</strong> – You can use it in Sweden as long as it’s valid. You don’t need to exchange it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you have a <strong>non-EU
          licence</strong> – You can drive with it in Sweden for up to <strong>12 months</strong>
          after moving here. After that, you’ll need to apply for a Swedish licence.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>📖 Read more on the official <a
    >Swedish Transport Agency site</a>.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h2>Step 2: Apply for a Driving Licence Permit (<em
    >Körkortstillstånd</em>)</h2>
    <p>If you don’t already have a valid licence that works in Sweden,
      your journey starts with a <strong>driving licence permit</strong>. This is essentially
      permission to begin training.</p>
    <p>The application includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A health declaration.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>An eyesight test.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A small application fee.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>👉 Apply directly via <a
    >Transportstyrelsen</a>.</p>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3: Choose a Driving School or Start with Private
      Lessons</h2>
    <p>As a student, you may not have family here to help with private
      driving lessons, so many international learners choose to go through a <strong>driving school
        (trafikskola)</strong>.</p>
    <p>Benefits of a school:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p
      >Instructors explain everything in <strong
      >Swedish and English</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Structured lessons to help you adapt to Swedish road
          rules.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Access to certified tracks for <em>Risk
          2</em> training (mandatory).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tip: Compare schools in your city, as prices can vary.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h2>Step 4: Complete the Mandatory Risk Education</h2>
    <p>Before you can book your tests, you need to complete <strong
    >Riskutbildning (Risk 1 and Risk 2)</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Risk 1</strong> – Theory about
        alcohol, drugs, fatigue, and distractions.</p></li>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Risk 2 (Halkbana)</strong> –
        Practical training on slippery roads.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We’ve covered both in detail here:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p
      ><a>Risk 1
        Guide</a></p></li>
      <li><p
      ><a>Risk 2
        Guide</a></p>
        <p><br></p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 5: Book the Tests with Trafikverket</h2>
    <p>Once you’re ready, you’ll need to pass two exams:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Theory Test (</strong><em
      ><strong>Kunskapsprov</strong></em><strong
      >)</strong> – 70 multiple-choice questions, available in English.</p></li>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Driving Test (</strong><em
      ><strong>Körprov</strong></em><strong>)</strong> –
        A practical exam with a Trafikverket examiner.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Both are booked via <a
    >Trafikverket</a>.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h2>Quick Tips for Foreign Students</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Language support</strong> – Many
        schools offer English training. Trafikverket also provides interpreters for tests if needed.</p></li>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Budgeting</strong> – Costs can
        add up (lessons, tests, risk training). On average, expect 15,000–25,000 SEK depending on how many lessons you
        need.</p></li>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Start early</strong> – Book Risk
        training and exams in advance—slots fill quickly, especially in bigger cities like Stockholm, Gothenburg, and
        Malmö.</p></li>
      <li><p
      ><br></p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Getting a Swedish driving licence as a foreign student may seem
      like a big task, but by starting with the <strong>right first steps</strong>—checking licence
      validity and applying for a driving licence permit—you’ll already be on the right track.</p>
    <p>From there, structured training, Risk education, and preparing
      for your exams will bring you closer to your goal of driving with confidence in Sweden.</p>
    <p>✅ <strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Even if you can
      legally drive in Sweden with your foreign licence for the first year, starting the process early will save you
      stress later.</p>`

    <h2>What is Risk 1?</h2>
    <p>Risk 1 is the <strong>theory-based
      part</strong> of Sweden’s mandatory risk education for B licence drivers. While Risk 2 (halkbana) focuses on
      practical driving in slippery conditions, Risk 1 looks at the <strong>human factors</strong>
      that contribute to accidents.</p>
    <p>During the course, you’ll discuss and reflect on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p
      >The dangers of <strong>alcohol and
        drugs</strong> while driving.</p></li>
      <li><p
      >How <strong>fatigue and
        distraction</strong> affect reaction times.</p></li>
      <li><p
      >Peer pressure, stress, and risky behavior behind the
        wheel.</p></li>
      <li><p
      >Real-world accident statistics and case studies.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>It’s not about memorizing facts—it’s about understanding how
      everyday choices can make the difference between a safe journey and a dangerous situation.</p>
    <h2>Why is Risk 1 Mandatory?</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Swedish Transport Agency
      (Transportstyrelsen)</strong> requires every licence candidate to complete Risk 1. The reasoning is clear: many
      road accidents are not caused by poor technical driving skills, but by <strong>bad
        decisions</strong>.</p>
    <p>By raising awareness of how substances, fatigue, and behavior
      impact driving, Sweden aims to reduce preventable accidents.</p>
    <p>📖 Learn more directly from <a
    >Transportstyrelsen’s official guide on Riskutbildning</a>.</p>
    <h2>When Should You Take Risk 1?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Timing:</strong> You can take
        Risk 1 early in your licence journey—even before you start practical driving. Many students complete it in the
        beginning.</p></li>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Validity:</strong> Risk 1 (and
        Risk 2) are both valid for <strong>five years</strong>.</p></li>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Requirement:</strong> You must
        have passed both Risk 1 and Risk 2 before you can book your theory and practical tests with Trafikverket.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>👉 Use <a>Trafikverket’s
      booking system</a> to find approved providers in your area.</p>
    <h2>What to Expect in Risk 1</h2>
    <p>Risk 1 usually takes <strong>3–4
      hours</strong> in a classroom or online environment led by a certified instructor.</p>
    <p>Here’s the structure you can expect:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Introduction</strong> – Goals
        of the training and expectations.</p></li>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Alcohol &amp; Drugs</strong> –
        Impact on judgment, coordination, and legal consequences.</p></li>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Fatigue &amp; Stress</strong> –
        How tiredness or pressure can be just as dangerous as alcohol.</p></li>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Distraction</strong> – Mobile
        phones, passengers, and multitasking while driving.</p></li>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Discussion &amp;
        Reflection</strong> – Group discussions, videos, and scenarios that encourage reflection.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>There is <strong>no exam</strong>—participation
      and engagement are what matter.</p>
    <h2>How to Prepare</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Come with an open mind</strong>
        – Risk 1 is about self-reflection more than memorization.</p></li>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Be ready to
        participate</strong> – Instructors often encourage questions and group discussions.</p></li>
      <li><p
      ><strong>Think about real-life
        situations</strong> – Relating the content to your own experiences makes it more impactful.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Risk 1 is not just a formality. It’s a chance to rethink how
      you approach driving and to understand the risks you might not normally consider. By completing this step,
      you’ll be one step closer to becoming a safer and more responsible driver on Sweden’s roads.</p>
    <p>✅ <strong>Next step after Risk 1:</strong>
      Once you’ve completed Risk 1, you’ll later move on to <strong>Risk 2 (the slippery track
        training)</strong>. Together, these two courses make up Sweden’s renowned <strong>Riskutbildning</strong>,
      preparing you for both the challenges of driving and the responsibility it carries.</p>

    <h2>What is Risk 2?</h2>
    <p>Risk 2 is the second part of the mandatory risk training in Sweden. While <strong>Risk 1</strong> covers
      alcohol, drugs, fatigue, and risky driving behavior in theory, Risk 2 is <strong>practical training</strong>
      that takes place on a specially designed track.</p>
    <p>During this course, you’ll practice:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Driving in slippery road conditions (ice, snow, wet surfaces).</p></li>
      <li><p>How speed, braking, and steering affect safety.</p></li>
      <li><p>Realistic scenarios of loss of control and how to recover.</p></li>
      <li><p>Safe following distances and how to avoid collisions.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>It’s commonly referred to as the <strong>slippery track test
      (</strong><em><strong>halkbanan</strong></em><strong>)</strong>, and it’s a hands-on experience that prepares
      you for real-life conditions.<br><br></p>
    <h2>Why is Risk 2 Mandatory?</h2>
    <p>The Swedish Transport Agency (<em>Transportstyrelsen</em>) requires all driving licence candidates to complete
      both Risk 1 and Risk 2 before being allowed to book the theory and practical driving tests.</p>
    <p>According to the Transport Agency, the goal is to <strong>reduce accidents caused by inexperience,
      overconfidence, or lack of preparation</strong> when driving in challenging conditions. Sweden’s climate makes
      this especially important, as roads can be icy or wet for a large part of the year.</p>
    <p>📖 You can read more directly on <a>Transportstyrelsen’s official site</a>.<br><br></p>
    <h2>When Should You Take Risk 2?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Timing matters:</strong> It’s recommended to take Risk 2 <strong>towards the end of your
        training</strong>, once you are comfortable with car handling and basic driving skills.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Validity:</strong> Both Risk 1 and Risk 2 are valid for <strong>five years</strong>. If you don’t
        pass your driving test within that time, you’ll need to retake them.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Booking:</strong> Only approved schools and tracks can conduct Risk 2. Make sure you book with a
        certified provider.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>👉 Find approved training providers through <a>Trafikverket’s booking service</a>.<br><br></p>
    <h2>What to Expect on the Day</h2>
    <p>Here’s what typically happens during Risk 2:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p><strong>Introduction &amp; Safety Briefing</strong> – You’ll start with a short theory session explaining
        the exercises.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Practical Exercises</strong> – Driving on different surfaces (wet, icy, slippery) at various
        speeds.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Emergency Situations</strong> – Simulated braking and obstacle avoidance.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Reflection Session</strong> – Discussion on what you learned, connecting practice to real-life
        road safety.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>It usually takes around <strong>3 hours</strong>, and while it can feel intimidating, it’s designed to be safe
      and controlled.<br><br></p>
    <h2>How to Prepare</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Practice driving first</strong> – You should be comfortable with gear shifting, braking, and
        steering before attempting Risk 2.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Dress appropriately</strong> – Wear comfortable clothes and shoes for driving.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Stay calm</strong> – Remember, the track is designed for learning, not testing. You cannot “fail”
        Risk 2 like an exam—you just need to participate.<br><br></p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Risk 2 is more than just a requirement—it’s an opportunity to gain confidence in situations that could one day
      save your life. By the time you complete it, you’ll understand why Sweden is known for its strong road safety
      culture.</p>
    <p>So, if you’re on your way to getting a licence in Sweden, make sure to <strong>book your Risk 2 course
      early</strong> and treat it as a valuable step toward becoming a safe, confident driver.</p>
    <p>✅ <strong>Next step after Risk 2:</strong> Once you’ve completed both Risk 1 and Risk 2, you’ll be eligible to
      book your <strong>theory test (kunskapsprov)</strong> and <strong>driving test (körprov)</strong> with
      Trafikverket.</p>

    text: `<p>Learning to drive is a significant milestone in one's life, marking the beginning of new freedoms and
      responsibilities. In Sweden, the journey to obtaining a driving license involves a comprehensive training
      program aimed at ensuring that new drivers are well prepared for the challenges that the roads present. An
      important part of this program is "Risk 1" (Riskutbildning 1), a mandatory risk education course aimed at
      promoting road safety.</p><h4>What is Risk 1?</h4>
    <p>Risk 1 is the first part of a two-part risk education program that all prospective drivers in Sweden must
      complete. This course focuses on various aspects of road safety, especially those related to human behavior and
      its impact on driving. The main topics covered in Risk 1 include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p><strong>Alcohol and Drugs</strong> : Participants learn about the serious effects of alcohol and drugs on
        driving ability. The course emphasizes the legal and personal consequences of driving under the influence,
        using real-life examples and statistics to underscore the dangers.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Fatigue and Risky Behaviors</strong> : Driving while tired is a significant risk factor for
        accidents. Risk 1 educates new drivers about the importance of adequate rest and the dangers of driving while
        tired. It also addresses other risk behaviors such as speeding, distracted driving, and aggressive driving.
      </p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Awareness and Responsibility</strong> : An important part of Risk 1 is to foster a sense of
        personal responsibility. Participants are encouraged to reflect on their attitudes towards driving and to
        develop an attitude that prioritizes safety over convenience or urgency.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Structure of Risk 1</h4>
    <p>Risk 1 is conducted in a classroom setting and typically lasts approximately three hours. The course is
      interactive and involves lectures, discussions, and sometimes group work or case studies. This engaging format
      helps ensure that participants not only understand the information, but also retain it and can apply it to
      real-world situations.</p><h4>Why is Risk 1 Important?</h4>
    <p>The primary goal of Risk 1 is to reduce road accidents and fatalities by equipping new drivers with the
      knowledge and attitudes required for safe driving. By addressing the human factors that contribute to road
      accidents, this course plays a crucial role in creating safer roads for everyone.</p>
    <p>In addition to its educational benefits, it is a legal requirement for anyone who wants to take the theory test
      and driving test in Sweden to complete Risk 1. Therefore, it is an important step in the process of obtaining a
      driver's license.</p><h4>Closing Thoughts</h4>
    <p>Risk 1 is more than just a mandatory course; it is an invaluable learning experience that helps shape
      responsible and aware drivers. By understanding the risks associated with driving and learning how to reduce
      them, new drivers can contribute to a safer traffic environment for everyone. So if you are about to get your
      driving license in Sweden, take the opportunity that Risk 1 offers to become a more knowledgeable and
      responsible driver.</p>`
